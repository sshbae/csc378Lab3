/**
 * This world contains the main part of the scrolling system.
 * 
 * Here you can also limit the world by changing the variables WORLD_WIDTH and WORLD_HEIGHT using the constructor of the class (see ExampleWorld).
 * You can create scrolling worlds in every screen size (the size of the frame) and every scrolling size (the real size of the world).
 * 
 * The GreenfootImage textur is the background image that is used for the scrolling background. You can use any image you want instead of this. 
 * You just have to call the method setScrollingBackground in the constructor of your scrolling world (see ExampleWorld) with the GreenfootImage you want to use for the background.
 * 
 * The scenario will automaticly create a example world. You can delete this world and use another subclass of this world if you want to use the scrolling system in your scenario.
 * 
 * 
 * You shouldn't change the code of this class because that will probably cause problems in the scrolling system.
